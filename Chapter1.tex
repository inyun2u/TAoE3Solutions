    Given that $P = \dfrac{V^2}{R}$, we know that the maximum voltage we can achieve is 15V and the smallest resistance we can have across the resistor in question is $1\k\Ohm$. Therefore, the maximum amount of power dissipated can be given by \[P = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{(15\V)^2}{1\k\Ohm} = \mans{0.225\W}\]
    This is less than the 1/4W power rating.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        With two equal-value resistors, the output voltage is half the input voltage.
        \[V_{out} = \frac{1}{2}V_{in} = \frac{30\V}{2} = \mans{15\V}\]

        \item 
        To treat $R_2$ and $R_{load}$ as a single resistor, combine the two resistors which are in parallel to find that the combined (equivalent) resistance is $5\k\Ohm$. Now, we have a simple voltage divider with a $10\k\Ohm$ resistor in series with the $5\k\Ohm$ equivalent resistor. The output voltage is across this equivalent resistance. The output voltage is given by 
        \[V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{5\k\Ohm}{10\k\Ohm + 5\k\Ohm} = \frac{30\V}{3} = \mans{10\V} \]
        \todo{Add a diagram to make this clearer}

        \item 
        We can redraw the voltage divider circuit to make the ``port'' clearer. 
        \begin{circuit}{fig:1.10.1}{Voltage divider with port shown.}
            % \label{1.10fig1}
            (0,2) to[V=$V_{\in}$] (0,0)
            to[short] (2,0)
            to[R=$R_2$] (2,2)
            to[R=$R_1$](0,2)
            (2,0) to[short, *-o] (3,0)
            (2,2) to[short, *-o] (3,2)
            (3,0) to[open, v_<=$V_\out$] (3,2)
        \end{circuit}

        We can find $V_{\Th}$ by leaving the ports open (open circuit) and measuring $V_\out$, the voltage across $R_2$. This comes out to be half the input voltage when $R_1 = R_2$, so $V_\out = 15\V$. Thus $V_{\Th} = \mans{15\V}$.
        
        To find the Th\'evinen resistance, we need to find the short circuit current, $I_{SC}$. We short circuit the port and measure the current flowing through it.
        \begin{circuit}{fig:1.10.2}{Voltage divider with short circuit on the output.}
            (0,2) to[V=$V_{\in}$] (0,0) 
            to[short] (2,0)
            to[R=$R_2$] (2,2)
            to[R=$R_1$](0,2)
            (2,0) to[short] (3,0)
            (2,2) to[short] (3,2)
            (3,0) to[short, i_<=$I_{SC}$] (3,2) 
        \end{circuit}
        
        In this circuit, no current flows through $R_2$, flowing through the short instead. Thus we have $I_{SC} = \dfrac{V_\in }{R_1}$. From this, we can find $R_\Th$ from $R_\Th = \dfrac{V_\Th}{I_{SC}}$. This gives us 
        \[R_\Th = \frac{V_\Th}{I_{SC}} = \frac{V_\Th}{V_\in/R_1} = \frac{15\V}{30\V/10\k\Ohm} = \mans{5\k\Ohm}\]

        The Th\'evenin equivalent circuit takes the form shown below.
        \begin{circuit}{fig:1.10.3}{Th\'evenin equivalent circuit.}
            (0,2) to[V=$V_{\Th}$] (0,0)
            to[short, -o] (3,0)
            (0,2) to[R=$R_{\Th}$, -o] (3,2)
            (3,0) to[open, v_<=$V_\out$] (3,2)
        \end{circuit}
        In terms of behavior at the ports, this circuit is equivalent to the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:1.10.1}. 

        \item 
        We connect the $10\k\Ohm$ load to the port of the Th\'evenin equivalent circuit in Figure \ref{fig:1.10.3} to get the following circuit.
        \begin{circuit}{fig:1.10.4}{Th\'evenin equivalent circuit with $10\k\Ohm$ load.}
            (0,2) to[V=$V_{\Th}$] (0,0)
            to[short] (3,0)
            (0,2) to[R=$R_{\Th}$] (3,2)
            (3,0) to[R=$10\k\Ohm$, v_<=$V_\out$] (3,2)
        \end{circuit}
        From here, we can find $V_\out$, treating this circuit as a voltage divider.
        \[V_\out = \frac{10\k\Ohm}{R_\Th + 10\k\Ohm} V_\Th = \frac{10\k\Ohm}{5\k\Ohm + 10\k\Ohm} \cdot 15\V = \mans{10\V}\] 
        This is the same answer we got in part (b).

        \item 
        To find the power dissipated in each resistor, we return to the original three-resistor circuit. 
        \begin{circuit}{fig:1.10.5}{Original voltage divider with $10\k\Ohm$ load attached.}
            (0,2) to[V, l_=$V_\in$] (0,0)
                to[short] (3,0)
                to[R, l_=$R_\load$] (3,2)
                to[short] (2,2)
                to[R=$R_1$] (0,2)
            (2,0) to[R=$R_2$, *-*] (2,2)
        \end{circuit}

        From part (d), we know that the output voltage is 10V and that this is the voltage across the load resistor. Since $P = IV = \frac{V^2}{R}$, we find that the power through $R_\load$ is 
        \[P_\load = \frac{V^2}{R_\load} = \frac{(10\V)^2}{10\k\Ohm} = \mans{10\m\W}\]
        Similarly, we know that the power across $R_2$ is the same since the voltage across $R_2$ is the same as the voltage across $R_\load$. Thus we have
        \[P_2 = \mans{10\m\W}\]
        To find the power dissipated in $R_1$, we first have to find the voltage across it. From Kirchoff's loop rule, we know that the voltage around any closed loop in the circuit must be zero. We can choose the loop going through the voltage source, $R_1$, and $R_2$. The voltage supplied by the source is 30V. The voltage dropped across $R_2$ is 10V as discussed before. Thus the voltage dropped across $R_1$ must be $30\V - 10\V - 20\V$. Now we know the voltage across and the resistance of $R_1$. We use the same formula as before to find the power dissipated.
        \[P_1 = \frac{V^2}{R_1} = \frac{(20\V)^2}{10\k\Ohm} = \mans{40\m\W}\]
    \end{enumerate}

    \ex{1.11}
    Consider the following Th\'evenin circuit where $R_\source$ is just another name for the Th\'evenin resistance, $R_\Th$.
    \begin{circuit}{fig:1.11.1}{Standard Th\'evenin circuit with attached load.}
        (0,2) to[V, l_=$V_\Th$] (0,0)
            to[short] (2,0)
            to[R, l_=$R_\load$] (2,2)
            to[R, l_=$R_\source$] (0,2)
    \end{circuit}
    We will first calculate the power dissipated in the load and then maximize it with calculus. We can find the power through a resistor using current and resistence since $P = IV = I(IR) = I^2R$. To find the total current flowing through the resistors, we find the equivalent resistance which is $R_\source + R_\load$. Thus the total current flowing is $I = \frac{V_\Th}{R_\source + R_\load}$. The power dissipated in $R_\load$ is thus 
    \[P_\load = I^2R_\load = \frac{V_\Th^2 R_\load}{(R_\source + R_\load)^2}\]
    To maximize this function, we take the derivative and set it equal to 0.
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{dP_\load}{dR_\load} &= V_\Th \frac{(R_\source + R_\load)^2 - 2R_\load(R_\source + R_\load)}{(R_\source + R_\load)^4} = 0 \\
        &\Longrightarrow R_\source + R_\load = 2R_\load \\
        &\Longrightarrow R_\source = R_\load
    \end{align*}

    There are two important facts to notice from Exericse 1.12:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item 
        An increase of 3dB corresponds to doubling the power 
        
        \item 
        An increase of 10dB corresponds to 10 times the power.
    \end{enumerate}
    Using these two facts, we can fill in the table. Start from 10dB. Fill in 7dB, 4dB, and 1dB using fact 1. Then fill in 11dB using fact 2. Then fill in 8dB, 5dB, and 2dB using fact 1 and approximating 3.125 as $\pi$.

    Recall the relationship between $I$, $V$, and $C$: $I = C\frac{dV}{dt}$. Now, we perform the integration:
    \begin{align*}
        \int dU &= \int_{t_0} ^{t_1} VIdt\\
        U &= \int_{t_0} ^{t_1} CV\frac{dV}{dt}dt\\
        &= C\int_0^{V_f} V dV\\
        U &= \frac{1}{2}CV_f^2
    \end{align*}

    \ex{1.15}
    Consider the following two capacitors in series.
    \begin{circuit}{fig:1.15.1}{Two capacitors in series.}
        (0,0) to[C=$C_1$] (2,0)
            to[C=$C_2$] (4,0)
        (-0.5,-0.5) to[open, v_>=$V_\text{total}$] (4.5,-0.5)
    \end{circuit}
    
    To prove the capacitance formula, we need to express the total capacitance of both of these capacitors in terms of the individual capacitances. From the definition of capacitance, we have 
    \[C_\text{total} = \frac{Q_\text{total}}{V_\text{total}}\]
    Notice that $V_\text{total}$ is the sum of the voltages across $C_1$ and $C_2$. We can get each of these voltages using the definition of capacitance.
    \[V_\text{total} = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{Q_1}{C_1} + \frac{Q_2}{C_2}\]
    The key observation now is that because the right plate of $C_1$ is connected to the left plate of $C_2$, the charge stored on both plates must be of equal magnitude.\footnotemark Therefore, we have $Q_1 = Q_2$. Let us call this charge stored $Q$ (i.e. $Q = Q_1 = Q_2$). Now, we know that the total charge stored is also $Q$.\footnotemark Therefore, we know that $Q_\text{total} = Q$. Now, we have 
    \[C_\text{total} = \frac{Q_\text{total}}{V_\text{total}} = \frac{Q}{Q_1/C_1 + Q_2/C_2} = \frac{Q}{Q/C_1 + Q/C_2} = \frac{1}{1/C_1 + 1/C_2}\]

    \footnotetext{If this were not true, then there would be a net charge on these two plates and the wire between them. Because we assume that the capacitors started out with no net charge and there is no way for charge to leave the middle wire or the two plates it connects, this is impossible. }

    \footnotetext{If you are having trouble seeing this, suppose we apply a positive voltage to the left plate of $C_1$ relative to the right plate of $C_2$. Suppose this causes the left plate of $C_1$ to charge to some charge $q$. We now must have a charge of $-q$ on the right plate of $C_1$ because $q$ units of charge are now pushed onto the left plate of $C_2$. Now the left of $C_2$ has $q$ units of charge which causes a corresponding $-q$ charge on the right side of $C_2$. Thus the overall total charge separated across these two capacitors is $q$. 
    }

    \ex{1.16}
    Equation 1.21 gives us the relationship between the time and the voltage ($V_\out$) across the capacitor while charging. To find the rise time, subtract the time it takes to reach 10\% of the final value from the time it takes to reach 90\% of the final value.
    \begin{align*}
        V_\out &= 0.1V_f = V_f(1-e^{-t_1/RC}) \\
        0.1 &= 1 - e^{-t_1/RC}\\ 
        t_1 &= -RC \ln(0.9)
    \end{align*}
    Similarly, we find that $t_2 = -RC \ln(0.1)$. Subtracting these two gives us 
    \[t_2 - t_1 = -RC(\ln(0.1) - \ln(0.9)) = 2.2RC\]

    \ex{1.17}
    The voltage divider on the left side of the circuit can be replaced with the Th\'evenin equivalent circuit found Exercise 1.10 (c). Recall that $V_\Th = \frac{1}{2} V_\in$ and $R_\Th = 5\k\Ohm$. This gives us the following circuit.
    \begin{circuit}{fig:1.17.1}{Th\'evenin equivalent circuit to Figure 1.36 from the textbook.}
        (0,2) to[open, v_>=$V_\Th$, o-o] (0,0) node[ground]{}
        
        (0,2) to[R=$R_\Th$] (3,2)
            to[C=$C$, *-] (3,0) node[ground]{}
        (3,2) to[short, -o] (5,2)
        to[open, v^>=$V(t)$, o-o] (5,0) node[ground]{}
    \end{circuit}

    Now we have a simple RC circuit which we can apply Equation 1.21 to. The voltage across the capacitor is given by 
    \[V(t) = V_\text{final}(1 - e^{-t/RC}) = V_\Th (1 - e^{-t/R_\Th C} = \mans{\frac{1}{2}V_\in (1 - e^{-t/5 \times 10^{-4}})}\]

    \todo{Add graph}

    \ex{1.18}
    From the capacitor equation in the previous paragraph, we have 
    \[V(t) = (I/C)t = (1 \m\A/1\u\F)t = 10\V\]
    This gives us
    \[\mans{t = 0.01\text{s}}\]

    \ex{1.19}
    The magnetic flux produced within the coil is proportional to the number of turns. Now, because the inductance of the inductor is proportional to the amount of magnetic flux that passes through all the coils, it is proportional to the product of the magnetic flux and the number of coils. Thus the inductance is propotional to the square of the number of turns.
    \todo{Check/clarify this answer}

    \ex{1.20}
    We can use the formula for the full-wave rectifier ripple voltage to find the capacitance.
    \[\frac{I_\load}{2fC} = \Delta V \le 0.1 \V_\pp\]
    The maximum load current is 10mA and assuming a standard wall outlet frequency of 60 Hz, we have
    \[C \ge \frac{10\m\A}{2\times 120\Hz \times 0.1\V} = \mans{417 \u\F}\]
    Now we need to find the AC input voltage. The peak voltage after rectification must be 10V (per the requirements). Since each phase of the AC signal must pass through 2 diode drops, we have to add this to find out what our AC peak-to-peak voltage must be. Thus we have
    \[V_{\in, \pp} = 10\V + 2(0.6\V) = \mans{11.2\V}\]

    \ex{1.30}
    $V_\out$ is simply the voltage at the output of an impedance voltage divider. We know that $Z_R = R$ and $Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C}$. Thus we have 
    \[V_\out = \frac{Z_C}{Z_R + Z_C} V_\in = \frac{\frac{1}{j \omega C}}{R + \frac{1}{j \omega C}} V_\in = \frac{1}{1 + j \omega R C} V_\in\]
    The magnitude of this expression can be found by multiplying by the complex conjugate and taking the square root.
    \[sqrt{V_\out V_\out^*} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \omega^2R^2C^2}}V_\in\]
